We used [this venmo data set](https://github.com/sa7mon/venmo-data) to extract discover what **creepy** personal information we could find in a public dataset.

## üöÄ&nbsp; Installation and Documentation

This [tutorial](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/) explained perfectly how to set MongoDB up on our Codam iMacs

By default, creepathon.py sets up a connection with mongodb at localhost:27017 without authentication.
You can use this script or build on top of it, to download the entire chunk of data or aggregate it into smaller parts.
Please read the documented code to see exactly what the code does and how it works

## ‚ù§Ô∏è&nbsp; Community

This entire project is **open source**. We have taken inspiration and used code from other open source projects,
so it's only natural we open our code to you as well.
We wouldn't have it any other way!
